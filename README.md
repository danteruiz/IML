# Inferno Math Library #

**Vector math library written in rust**
</div>

I wrote a simple vector math library while writing a simple physical based renderer. 
I decided to split this out to it own project so I can easily make changes.

## Features
 * Library implements the following types (currently supports floats)
    * Vec2
	* Vec3
	* Quat(Limited implementation)
	* Mat3
	* Mat4

I plan to flush out this library, use it project to gain better understanding of the rust language and linear algebra.
